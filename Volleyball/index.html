	  <h3> How volleyball came to be in my life</h3>
   <p> Volleyball is a sport I started because my dad had played pick-me-up games in college, then my older sister played in a club. I decided that maybe I'll play sometime and just try it a little bit. So I went to the gym with my dad and played with him a little bit on the wallyball courts, and learned the basic skills. This is the start of it. Then when the time came for the next club season I decided that I liked volleyball and went to tryouts, made a team and started working with my team. My dad was a setter and same with my sister, so naturally I became a setter too. It was so fun, my team, we kinda sucked. It's ok though we were like 12. Our team was hard working and never gave up. Then my second year I was one of the taller ones on my team and so I became a middle blocker. I barely ever jumped. But I was acceptable at hitting so it was fine. We were the first team in our entire club that won gold in a tournament. That was a super fun year too. My third year I got the same coach I had in my first year, and 3 of the same teammates from the first year too. I, once again played middle blocker, still didn't jump. But I was still able to make smart plays with my vertical of like 1 inch and I blocked sometimes, touched the ball at least. This team was awesome, I love those people. This is my fourth year of playing, 3 people from my team last year, I play outside hitter and I'm jumping and I have a way better hit, I might have to take a break next year since I'm taking a lot of classes but it's alright, I'll still go and play with my dad, and keep up on my work, but it depends on my school schedule. </p>

	  <h3> Where I'm going with volleyball</h3>
	  <p> I'm not sure where I want to go with volleyball but it's become something pretty big in my life and I want to continue to play and work hard, but at this time in my life it's where I make a lot of decisions for myself and where I develop as a person going into society. For now the plan is to keep doing volleyball for as long as I can until it just becomes too much. I want to continue because it's fun and it's kinda like a break from all of the other things I have going on, it feels free. But until that time comes I'll work my hardest to become a better volleyball player and teammate they can rely on, on the court and off. </p>
